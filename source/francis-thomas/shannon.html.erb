				<h2 class="extra-bottom extra-top">This is how one of the saddest days of my life began.</h2>
				<p>I awoke to this stream of messages, the reality sinking in, shaking me, and taking away my ability to speak. I called my mom at the hospital. I saw my Pawpaw, the man who formed me in so many ways, so small and so quiet (despite being so rattly).</p>
				<p>Number One Grandpa, I will remember this as the last time I saw you, but this is not how I choose to remember you.</p>

				<h2 class="extra-bottom extra-top">When I was a kid, you treated me like an adult. When I behaved like a child, you lost your patience. That's alright though, this is one of many things we have in common.</h2>
				<p>I used to spend so much time at your house. We'd watch Jeopardy every day, always celebrating the Daily Double. We'd play Monopoly, and if I was the banker and winning, you'd call me crooked. You taught me to play poker, but only with the red, blue, and white plastic chips.</p>
				<p class="extra-bottom">Remember when we were climbing on the white pipe sculpture at Laumeier and I fell onto my back? I suppose that's one reason they ask people not to climb on the art, but it just looked so climbable, didn't it? I had the wind knocked out of me and couldn't speak, and you were terrified.</p>

				<p class="extra-top">There are so many smells I associate with you. Old books whose pages, when flipped, give off a rustic vanilla smell. The smell of the Louis Street basement, where you had your big wooden desk with the glass top. And thunderstorms. I don't see those so much in Amsterdam… We'd sit on the porch, smelling the rain, listening to the thunder, and barely staying dry.</p>
				<p>And 1993, when there were too many storms and the rivers all swelled. You were picking me up from school then, driving the maroon Toyota Carolla, and you had to present a flood pass to drive onto Louis Street.</p>
				<p>Those drives are so full of memories. We used to test ourselves on state capitals, and would always confuse North and South Dakota. It's Bismark and Pierre respectively, but I still needed Google to confirm.</p>
				<p class="extra-bottom">Then we'd burst in the door, and Memaw would be in the kitchen. You'd exclaim, "What's for sup, pup?" You loved pestering the Memaw, your silver-haired princess.</p>

				<h2 class="extra-bottom extra-top">You introduced me to art and poetry, and were always so proud of me.</h2>
				<p>One night, while you were watching the St. Louis Blues play hockey, I drew the blue note from their uniform. Even after many art shows and after I was a world-travelling designer, you kept that little crayon drawing. Every super hero needs an origin story.</p>
				<p>Once I drew you a "beautiful singing bird" sign. Partly because it was true, and partly to annoy the Memaw. You hung it on your bedroom door with pride.</p>
				<p class="extra-bottom">You collected my masterpieces and hung them proudly. The Clever School Girl and Rapunzel will be lost without you.</p>

				<p class="extra-top">When I was in my early twenties, we'd have breakfast every other Saturday. We'd eat breakfast and then talk for a few hours, working up our appetites for some ice cream. You tought me well – I still have ice cream every night.</p>
				<p>You were a lover of history, and it grounded you. You approached everyone and everything with an open mind, and I could have conversations with you that my friends couldn't have with their own parents.</p>
				<h2 class="extra-top extra-bottom">And of course there were the stories. So. Many. Stories. I love the story about <a href="/francis-thomas/dropping-water.html">dropping the cup of water onto the convertable</a>.</h2>
				<p class="extra-bottom">You and Hans were birds of a feather. One year for Christmas, you bought a pair berets. You described finding an ad for a haberdashery in Oregon and calling to make the order: one red and one black. Hans has the red one. You kept the black.</p>

				<p class="extra-top">Papaw, you were a mountain. And I'm so thankful I got to spend so much time with you.</p>
				<h2 class="extra-bottom">But still, it's hard not to notice when a mountain goes missing.</h2>
